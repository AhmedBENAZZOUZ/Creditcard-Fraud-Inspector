# üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data, following the **CRISP-DM** methodology. The objective is to build a predictive system that can effectively distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions, despite the strong class imbalance.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and contains **284,807** transactions, of which only **0.17% are frauds**.

## üìå Project Structure

This notebook is structured using the **CRISP-DM** data science methodology:

1. **Business Understanding**  
   - Goal: Detect fraudulent transactions to reduce financial loss.

2. **Data Understanding**  
   - Explore distributions, visualize fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.
   - Analyze correlations and identify key trends.

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Normalize features, handle class imbalance with **SMOTE**.
   - Apply **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.

4. **Modeling**  
   - Models used: Logistic Regression, LDA, SVM, Random Forest.
   - Hyperparameter tuning and ensemble techniques.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
   - Visuals: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Feature Importance.

6. **Deployment/Conclusion**  
   - Random Forest offered the best recall.
   - Future work: Model explainability (e.g., SHAP), real-time detection pipeline.
